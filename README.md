An Electron-based, multiplatform music player app that streams from multiple sources

## What is this?
nuclear is a free music streaming program that pulls content from free sources all over the internet.

If you know [mps-youtube](https://github.com/mps-youtube/mps-youtube), this is a similar music player but with a GUI.
It's also focusing more on audio. Imagine Spotify which you don't have to pay for and with a bigger library.

## Screenshots
This will be updated as the program evolves.
